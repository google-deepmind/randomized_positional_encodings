  """A task with the goal of multiplying two numbers in binary (little-endian).

  The input is a string of the form `first_numberÂ£second_number` in
  (little-endian) binary notation (e.g., `01001*011`). The goal of the agent is
  to output the result, also in (little-endian) binary form (i.e., in the
  example `18 * 6 = 108 = 00110011`). The output is padded with 0s to match the
  input length, and the end of the product is denoted with a termination token
  (i.e., the output has values in `{0, 1, 2}`).

  Examples:
    001 * 01101   = 000110120     (4 * 22 = 88)
    1001 * 000001 = 00000100120   (9 * 32 = 288)
